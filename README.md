## **üìù Description**

This project applies a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** metaheuristic to tackle the **Music Festival Lineup Optimization problem**. The primary goal is to determine the optimal schedule for 35 artists across **5 stages** and **7 time slots**. The "optimal" lineup is defined by its ability to successfully balance three equally weighted criteria: maximizing prime-time slot popularity, maximizing simultaneous genre diversity, and minimizing scheduling conflicts due to overlapping fan bases.

## **‚ú® Objective**

The main objectives of this project are to:

-   **Develop a Genetic Algorithm** to find high-quality festival lineups.
-   **Maximize the popularity** of artists performing in prime time slots (the final slot on each stage).
-   **Maximize the diversity** of musical genres offered simultaneously across different stages within each time slot.
-   **Minimize scheduling conflicts** arising from artists with overlapping fan bases performing concurrently.
-   **Evaluate different GA configurations** (selection, crossover, mutation operators, elitism) to identify the most effective strategies.
-   **(Extra)** Compare the GA's performance against other optimization heuristics like **Hill Climbing** and **Simulated Annealing**.

## **üìö Context**

This project was undertaken as part of the **Computational Intelligence for Optimization (CIFO)** course in the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics program at **NOVA IMS**. The problem statement and dataset were provided within the course, challenging us to apply and extend concepts learned in class to a complex optimization scenario.

**Dataset Source:** The project utilizes two primary CSV files:
*   `artists(in).csv`: Contains details for each of the 35 artists, including their unique name, primary music genre, and a popularity score (0-100).
*   `conflicts(in).csv`: A square matrix representing the degree of fan base conflict (0-1) between any two artists if they perform simultaneously.

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Structure**

The project follows a structured approach, guiding the process from understanding the problem to analyzing the results.

1.  **Problem Understanding & Definition:** üí°
    *   **Problem:** Schedule 35 unique artists into 35 slots (5 stages x 7 time slots) to optimize three conflicting objectives.
    *   **Objective Function:** A weighted sum of normalized scores for prime slot popularity, genre diversity, and conflict minimization (1 - normalized conflict). Weights are 1/3 for each.
    *   **Constraints:** Each artist assigned exactly once; no empty slots; all slots/stages uniform. Invalid solutions (duplicates, unassigned artists) are not permitted in the population.

## üìà Key Results


-   **Best Performing GA Configuration (Overall Peak Fitness):** `Rank & Cycle & Stage Shuffle & Elitism=False` (Fitness: ~0.8801).
-   **Best Performing GA Configuration (Median Final Fitness):** `Rank & Cycle & Stage Shuffle & Elitism=True` (Median Fitness at Gen 100: ~0.8573 ¬± 0.0065).
-   **Operator Impact:**
    *   **Crossover:** `Cycle` crossover variants generally led to higher median fitness than `Order` crossover.
    *   **Mutation:** `Stage Shuffle` mutation often featured in top configurations, suggesting its effectiveness in exploring diverse schedule arrangements.
    *   **Selection:** `Rank` selection paired with `Cycle` crossover was a consistently strong combination. `Tournament` selection also yielded competitive results, especially with `Cycle` crossover.
-   **Elitism:** Generally beneficial, helping to preserve the best solutions found and often leading to slightly higher median fitness values in later generations, though configurations without elitism also achieved top peak fitness.
-   **Comparison with Other Heuristics:**
    *   The best GA configurations significantly outperformed Hill Climbing.
    *   The best GA configurations performed comparably to Simulated Annealing, with no statistically significant difference in their final median fitness distributions.

## üìö Conclusion & Future Work

This project successfully demonstrated the application of Genetic Algorithms to the complex, multi-objective problem of music festival lineup optimization. The implemented GA, with carefully chosen operators and parameters, was able to find high-quality solutions that effectively balance artist popularity, genre diversity, and fan conflicts.

**Future Work could explore:**
*   More sophisticated multi-objective optimization techniques
*   Adaptive parameter tuning for GA operators.
*   Hybrid approaches combining GA with local search methods.
*   A hyperparameter optimization for Simulated Annealing ($C$, $L$, $T$) to improve its performance.
