#      Music Festival Lineup Optimization - Problem Definition for GA Solution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Description: The Music Festival Lineup Optimization problem involves assigning a set
#              of N artists to S stages and T time slots. The goal is to find a lineup
#              that optimizes three equally important criteria:
#              1. Maximize Prime Slot Popularity: Popular artists in the last slot of each stage.
#              2. Maximize Genre Diversity: Variety of genres per time slot across stages.
#              3. Minimize Conflict Penalty: Reduce overlaps for artists with shared fan bases.
#
# Search Space: All possible valid permutations of N artists across S*T available slots.
#               A valid solution has each artist scheduled exactly once.
#
# Representation of an Individual (Solution):
#              A 2D numpy array (matrix) of shape (NUM_STAGES, NUM_SLOTS), where each cell
#              (s, t) contains the unique ID of the artist scheduled on stage 's' at time slot 't'.
#              This matrix must contain a permutation of all artist IDs.
#
# Constraints:
#              - Each artist is assigned to exactly one stage and one time slot.
#              - All artists are assigned (total artists N = NUM_STAGES * NUM_SLOTS).
#              - Genetic operators must maintain these constraints, always producing valid lineups.
#
# Fitness Function: f(L) = (1/3 * N_pop(L)) + (1/3 * N_div(L)) + (1/3 * (1 - N_con(L)))
#               Where:
#                   - N_pop(L): Normalized prime slot popularity score [0, 1].
#                   - N_div(L): Normalized genre diversity score [0, 1].
#                   - N_con(L): Normalized conflict penalty score [0, 1].
#               The components are normalized against their theoretical maximums/worst-cases.
#               (1 - N_con(L)) is used because conflict is a penalty to be minimized.
#
# Goal: Maximize f(L).
#
# Neighbors (for Heuristics like Hill Climbing/Simulated Annealing):
#              A neighbor solution can be obtained by swapping the assignments of two artists
#              in the schedule.
