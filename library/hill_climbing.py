# Hill Climbing Algorithm
def hill_climbing(initial_solution: LineupSolutionHC, maximization=False, max_iter=99999, verbose=False):
    """
    Implementation of the Hill Climbing optimization algorithm.  

    The algorithm iteratively explores the neighbors of the current solution, moving to a neighbor if it improves the objective function.  
    The process continues until no improvement is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.  

    Args:
        initial_solution (LineupSolutionHC): The starting solution, which must implement the `fitness()` and `get_neighbors()` methods.
        maximization (bool, optional): If True, the algorithm maximizes the fitness function; otherwise, it minimizes it. Defaults to False.
        max_iter (int, optional): The maximum number of iterations allowed before stopping. Defaults to 99,999.
        verbose (bool, optional): If True, prints progress details during execution. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        LineupSolutionHC: The best solution found during the search.

    Notes:
        - The initial_solution must implement a `fitness()` and `get_neighbors()` method.
        - The algorithm does not guarantee a global optimum; it only finds a local optimum.
