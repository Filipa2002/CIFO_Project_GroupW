    """Implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm.

    The algorithm iteratively explores the search space using a random neighbor of the
    current solution. If a better neighbor is found, the current solution is replaced by
    that neighbor. Otherwise, the solution may still be replaced by the neighbor with a certain
    probability. This probability decreases throughout the execution. The process continues until
    the maximum number of iterations is reached.  

    The convergence speed of this algorithms depends on the initial value of control parameter C,
    he speed at which C is decreased (H), and the number of iterations in which the same C is
    maitained (L).


    Params:
        - initial_solution (SASolution): Initial solution to the optimization problem

        - L (int): Number of iterations with same C
        - H (float): Decreasing rate of C
        - maximization (bool): Is maximization problem?
        - max_iter (int): Maximum number of iterations
        - verbose (bool): If True, prints progress details during execution. Defaults to False.
